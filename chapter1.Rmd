# About the project

This is a playground for experimenting with something called R Markdown. It seems to be a fairly simple mark-up language whose _raison d'etre_ is to enable the embedding of "live" R code into web pages and other interactive documents. 

[This](https://jkruohon.github.io/IODS-project/) is a link to the very page you're looking at right now, as required by the instructions. Some more useful links are listed below:


[Repository page](https://github.com/jkruohon/IODS-project)

[R Markdown basics](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) (same link as on MOOC)

[Embedding R code into a document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html) (same link as on MOOC)

[R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) (a different one!)

[Regular expression cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf) (we linguists use regexes a lot!)

The [theme](http://bootswatch.com/) used for this page is called _readable_.
